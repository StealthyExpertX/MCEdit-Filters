//Note this is un-official Minecraft Documentation on Loot Tables & Villager Trade Functions,
//all contributions are very much appreciated.

//Note: will crash the game if your loot table has bad syntax it will crash the game when killing an entity,
//Note: will crash the game if the trade table has bad syntax it will crash the game when loading the world or will display the trades blank.

// Note: "Wants" key in trade tables does not currently accept items with functions meaning that it will display the item in trade but 
//will accept any item that matches this item even if it's not named or enchanted or has custom lore :(.

//Note: trade table behavior-component must be added in as a component group in "component groups" and not added directly in the "components",
//or the trades will all render blank even though the json may use the correct syntax.

//but swords, axes, armor can be.

//treasure' will increase likely hood that the enchant is op.
